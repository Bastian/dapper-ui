# ðŸ¤µ Dapper UI

![Component Examples](.github/component-example.png)

Dapper UI is a UI library for Svelte. It is built on top of [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), but can also be used without it.

A small demo of the components is available at [https://bastian.github.io/dapper-ui/](https://bastian.github.io/dapper-ui/).

This is a project that is still under development and is very experimental. It is not recommended to use it in production or for serious projects.

## Install

```bash
npm i @dapper-ui/core
```

(not tested, might not work yet)

## Usage

Any component that is used must be a child of the `ThemeProvider` component. It is recommended to use it as high up in the component tree as possible.

```svelte
<ThemeProvider>
	<Button>Click me!</Button>
</ThemeProvider>
```

## Current State of Development

Components and structure are still experimental and can change at any time.
Hell, not even the name is final and can change.

Do not use this in production, but if you like it, feel free to star this repository to show your interest.

## Contributing

At this stage of development, I am not looking for contributions.
